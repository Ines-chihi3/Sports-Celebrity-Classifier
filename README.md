# Sports-Celebrity-Classifier

In this data science and machine learning project, I build a model to classify sports celebrity. I restrict classification to only 5 people

* Lionel Messi
* Malek Jaziri
* Ons jabeur
* Rafael Nadal
* Maria Sharapova


While working on this project I followed these steps: 

* 1) Data collection using "fatkun" chrome extention
* 2) Use Opencv library for face and eyes detection
* 3) Data Cleaning using a technique of opencv called haar cascades for face and eyes detection
* 4) Extracting meaning features using wavelet transforms 
* 5) Model building using defferent ML algorythmes of Sklearn librairy (SVM, logistic regression, random  forest )
* 6) Model fine tunning using gridsearchcv
* 7) Export model to a file using joblib librairy
* 8) Write python flask server that can server http requests generated by UI
* 9) Build UI using HTML,CSS,javascript and JQuery used to make http calls to python flask backend


Here is the folder structure :

* Website : This contains ui website code
* server: Python flask server
* model: Contains python notebook for model building
